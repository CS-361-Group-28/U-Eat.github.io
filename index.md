# Documents:
1. [**Requirements**](HW1-Requirements.pdf)
	- The Requirements document describes the function and non-function project requirements and
	specifications. We've also included three requirement use cases with state charts. A system
	overview is shown by a UML and Dataflow diagram.
2. [**Requirements Evaluation**](HW2-EvaluatingRequirements.pdf)
	- The Requirements Evaluation document presents a series of paper prototypes for evaulating
	various use case scenarios and potential user interfaces, as well as a revision of the
	previous document based on feedback from our customer, as summarized in the change log.
3. [**System Architecture**](HW3-Architecture.pdf)
	- The Architecture document explores two potential architectures for our system. The systems
	are described with a high-level diagram and compared across a variety of system quality
	attributes. A failure modes analysis is also carried out and diagramed to assist with the
	selection of the most appropriate architecture. The selected architecture is then validated
	in relation to common use cases and the implications of its selection is discussed.
4. [**System Design**](HW4-Design.pdf)
	- The System Design document discusses the aspects of coupling and cohesion involved in with
	our implementation packaging, as well as our approach to the development model and potentially 
	useful design patterns. Several interface contracts are described and exception handling of 
	potential error states are discussed. 
5. [**User Stories**](HW5-UserStories.pdf)
	- The User Stories document details user stories provided by the project customer and their
	deconstruction into agile development tasks. The tasks are prioritized based on customer input
	and a plan is made for the first development cycle.
6. [**Agile Implementation Stage 1**](HW6-ImplementationStage1.pdf)
	- The Impolementation Stage 1 document details our first week of agile development.
